# Microsoft AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies

## Manage Identity and Access

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Azure Active Directory
+ Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity management service
+ Can be intergrated with an existing Windows Server Active Directory
+ Uses HTTPS queries instead of LDAP
+ Has a flat structure i.e. no GPOs / OUs

### Configure Azure Active Directoty Identities
+ The **synchronized identity** model is the most common (SSO)
+ Azure AD Connect and **password writeback** facilitate this model
+ Password writeback is required for **AAD self-service password reset**
+ **Pass Through Authentications** (PTA) forwards request to on-prem AD (log-on hours)
+ Two types of auth for service pricipals: **secret** or **certificate**
+ Managed identity types are **system assigned** (lowest effort on tems of lifecycle management) and **user assigned** (can be shared across multiple resources)

### Configure Secure Access using Azure AD
+ Monitor privleged acess for Azure AD **Privileged Identity Management** (PIM)
+ Configure access reviews
+ Activate and configure PIM - to delegate access to PIM, a Global Admin can assign other users to the Privileged Administrator Role
+ Implemention conditional access policies _including_ Multi-Factor Autentication (MFA)
+ Configure Azure AD Identity Protection
+ Microsoft recommends ZERO permanently active assignments
+ Know who can manage assignments for other admins in PIM: 
    + Azure AD roles: Only **Privileged Role Administrators** and **Global Administrator**
    + Azure resource roles: Only **subscription admin**, **resource Owner**, **resource User Access Administrators**

> For the exam, know how to configure Privileged Identity Management and the configuration options for PIM access reviews

+ Know how to configure Azure AD **Conditional Access**
+ Know what Identity Protection brings to Conditional Access (_sign-in risk_)
+ Know licencing required for AD Identity Protection
