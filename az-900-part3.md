```ps1
Install-Module Az -Force -AllowClobber
#sign in
Connect-AzureAD 
$domain = "domain.onmicrosoft.com"

### Managing Users with Azure PowerShell
$passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
$PasswordProfile.Password = "p@ssword1"

### Get the existing user
Get-AzureADUser -SearchString "PE"
Get-AzureADUser -Filter "State eq 'PE'"

### Create a new user storing all the parameters in a hash table
$user = @{
  City = "Pennsylvania"
  Country = "United States"
  DisplayName = "Michael Scott"
  JobTitle = "Regional Manager"
  UserPrincipalName = mscott@domain
  PasswordProfile = $PasswordProfile
  PostalCode = "19001"

  Street Address = "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc."
  Surname = "Scott"
  TelephoneNumber = "215-867-5309"
  AccountEnabled = $true
  UsageLocation = "US"
}

### pass the hash table of parameters
$newUser = New-AzureADUser @user

### Creating & Managing Groups with PowerShell 

Find-Module AzureAD
Install-Module AzureAD
Import-Module -Name AzureAD

### Get credentials to connect
$AzureADCredentials = Get-Credential -Message "Login to Azure AD"
