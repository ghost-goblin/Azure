## ðŸ¤‘ Describe **Azure cost management** and **Service Level Agreements**

### Describe methods for planning and managing costs
1. Identify factors that can affect costs (resource types, services, locations, ingress and egress traffic)
+ More information about Azure Pricing can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/#product-pricing)
+ [App Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/windows/):
    - **Free**
    - **Shared Environment** for dev/test
    - **Basic Dedicated** environment for dev/test
    - **Standard** Run production workloads
    - **Premium** Enhanced performance and scale
    - **Isolated High-Performance**, Security and Isolation


|                              | Free   | Shared      | Basic       | Standard   | Premium    | Isolated   |

2. Identify factors that can reduce costs (reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing)
+ Azure **Reserved Instances** often offer 40% or more savings off of the price of pay-as-you-go virtual machines

3. Describe the functionality and usage of the **Pricing calculator** and the **Total Cost of Ownership** (TCO) **calculator**
+ [Total Cost of Ownership Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/tco/calculator/)

4. Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Cost Management**

### Describe Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and service lifecycles
1. Describe the purpose of an Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)
+ [Using business metrics to design resilient Azure applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/business-metrics#understand-service-levelagreements)
+ Check out the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) to see which services Azure offers in **Public Preview** _(excluded from the SLA and Limited Warranty)_

- - -

2. Identify actions that can impact an SLA (i.e. Availability Zones)
+ [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/support/legal/sla/summary/) summary for Azure services


- - -

3. Describe the service lifecycle in Azure (Public Preview and General Availability)
+ [Lifecycle FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/azure?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003556) defines how every Azure service is released for public use
