## ðŸ¤‘ Describe **Azure cost management** and **Service Level Agreements**

### Describe methods for planning and managing costs
1. Identify factors that can affect costs (resource types, services, locations, ingress and egress traffic)
+ **Ingress** bandwidth is _free_; you pay for **egress** (outbound)
+ If you don't want to spend over a certain amount, implement a spending limit in the account center
+ Using up the free credits causes all your resources to be stopped until you decide to get a paid account
+ Cloud pricing is complicated, usually any service is priced by 2 or 3 metrics combined, more information about [Azure Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/#product-pricing)
  + [Using business metrics to design resilient Azure applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/business-metrics#understand-service-levelagreements)
+ [App Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/app-service/windows/):
    - **Free**
    - **Shared Environment** for dev/test
    - **Basic Dedicated** environment for dev/test
    - **Standard** Run production workloads
    - **Premium** Enhanced performance and scale
    - **Isolated High-Performance**, Security and Isolation

2. Identify factors that can reduce costs (reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing)
+ Azure **Reserved Instances** often offer 40% or more savings off of the price of pay-as-you-go virtual machines
+ **Azure Spot Instances** make use of Microsoft's leftover Compute Capacity
+ **Azure Budgets** will notify you when your expenditure is nearing the limit, allowing you to take appropriate action

3. Describe the functionality and usage of the **Pricing calculator** and the **Total Cost of Ownership** (TCO) **calculator**
+ **Pricing calculator** is a tool that can be used to assist us in understanding the
costs of Azure services and features. It simply calculates the cost of Azure Services
+ [Total Cost of Ownership Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/tco/calculator/) calculates the cost reductions that could be obtained by moving your workloads to Azure

4. Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Cost Management**

### Describe Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and service lifecycles
1. Describe the purpose of an Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- [Compare support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/)
+ The **Basic Support** plan is the default
+ To have a **Standard** Plan, it needs to be purchased
