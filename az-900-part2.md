## üöí Describe core Azure Services

### Describe the core Azure architectural components
1. Describe the benefits and usage of **Regions** and **Region Pairs**
+ An **Azure Region** is a set of Datacenters that are connected through a dedicated low-latency network
+ A region could be made up of one or multiple datacenters
+ A **Region Pair** is a relationship between 2 Azure Regions within the sane geographic region for disaster recovery purposes

- - -

2. Describe the benefits and usage of **Availability Zones**
+ **Availability Zones** are physically seperate locations within each Azure region that are [tolerant to local failures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview)     
+ Azure Data Centre Regions & Availability Zones
  - Physical Deployment
  - High Availability & Disaster Recovery
  - You need to choose the **region** (a.k.a. the datacentre/s) where you want the instance of the service created
  - Not all Azure services are available in all regions

- - -

3. Describe the benefits and usage of **Resource Groups**
+ A resource is just a managable item in the cloud:
  + Virtual Machines
  + Storage Accounts
  + Web Apps
  + Databases
  + VNETs    
+ A **Resource Group** is a logical container where you are creating your Azure resources
+ A **Resource Group** created in a specific region can contain the resources created in the other regions
+ If you go to the `Access Control (IAM)` section of the resource, you will see that the _permissions_ are inherited from the Resource Group
+ Resources share the same lifecycle i.e. deploy, update, delete together
+ Resources can only exist in one Resource Group
+ Resource can communicate across Resource Groups
+ Container for security boundaries
+ Can export IAAS using __Resource Manager Templates__
+ Resources can be in different regions

- - -

4. Describe the benefits and usage of **Subscriptions**
+ To use Azure's cloud-based services, you must first purchase a subscription
+ Highest level Azure resource
+ Each subscription has a unique ID
+ Subscriptions have quotas
+ A subscription is the parent of the Resource Group


- - -

5. Describe the benefits and usage of **Management Groups**
+ A logical construct
+ Organise multiple Azure subscriptions or other Management Groups


- - -

6. Describe the benefits and usage of **[Azure Resource Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview)** (ARM)
+ Azure provides 4 levels of scope: 

| Scope             | Level           |
| :---------------- |:---------------:|
| Management Groups | 1               |
| Subscriptions     | 2               |
| Resource Groups   | 3               |
| Resources         | 4               |
+ A deployment and management service for Azure and it's central to the management of resources
+ The Azure Portal sends instructions to the ARM endpoint, ARM handles authentication using Active Directory (Azure AD) and authorises the request
+ ARM then sends the request to the service you are attemting to create or manipulate (App service, VM, etc.)
+ ARM is used by __ALL__ the tools to manage resources
  - Azure Portal
  - Azure PowerShell
  - Azure CLI
  - REST interface (an architectural style or design pattern for APIs)

7. Explain Azure resources
+ A **Resource Group** is a container that hold related resources.
  + Resources share the same lifecycle i.e. deploy, update, delete together
  + Resources can only exist in one Resource Group
  + Resource can communicate across Resource Groups
  + Container for security boundaries
  + Can export IAAS using __Resource Manager Templates__
  + Resources can be in different regions

### Describe core resources available in Azure
1. Describe the benefits and usage of **Virtual Machines**, **Azure App Services**, **Azure Container Instances** (ACI), **Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS), and **Azure Virtual Desktop**
+ Virtual Machines virtualise the hardware while containers virtualise the operating system on a runtime instead of a hypervisor
+ **IaaS** makes up the Infrastructure that constitutes your Azure Virtual Machines
+ URL to manage Azure Web Apps: [https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub](https://portal.azure.com/#create/hub)

#### Compute services - _executing code on the cloud_
+ **Virtual Machines**
  - IaaS
  + Full control over the OS
  + Must maintain and patch VM
  - Take an existing machine from your environment into the cloud - _a copy_
  - Windows or Linux operating systems - several of each
  - A "slice" of physical machine shared with other customers
  - Full control over it, as if it was your machine
  - Over 200 Virtual Machine types to choose from
  - Number of CPU cores, CPU speed, RAM size, temporary disk size, IOPS, etc.
+ **VM Scale Sets** (VMSS)
  - Elasticity
  - 2 or more VMs running the exact same code
  - A **Load Balancer** in front to direct traffic randomly to one of the machines
  - Autoscaling: add more and reduce machines on demand
  - Can handle up to 100 VMs in a single scale set
  - Can be configured to increase that to 1000 VMs in a single scale set
+ **App services** (Web apps)
    + Web Apps
    + API Apps
    + Mobile Apps
    + Containers
    + WebJobs
  - A new paradigm for running code in the cloud
  - Give your code and configuration to Azure, and they will run it
  - Promise of performance with no access to physical hardware
  - PaaS
+ **Azure Container Instances** (ACI)
  - Containers contain everything the app needs to run in a "container image"
  - Fastest and easiest to deploy
  + Hosting options for Containers:
    1. Local Workstation
    2. On-premises Servers
    3. VMs in Azure
    4. Azure Container Instances (ACI) [__Small scale__]
    5. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) [__Large scale__]
    6. Azure App Service
+ **Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS)
  + A container management system that runs in the cloud, can scale, monitor and deploy your container-based applications
  + **Pods** are groups of containers with shared storage and network resources
  + Nodes are virtual machines in AKS and can leverage VM scale sets
  + Azure Container Registry
  + Azure Monitor
  - runs on a cluster of servers, enterprise-grade
+ **Windows Virtual Desktop**

2. üåê Describe the benefits and usage of **Virtual Networks**, **VPN Gateway**, **Virtual Network peering**, and **ExpressRoute**
- A **Virtual Network** emulates a physical network
- A **[VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/design)** sends encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet
- **[Point-to-Site VPN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/point-to-site-about)** lets you create a secure connection to your virtual network from an **individual** client computer
- A **Site-to-Site VPN** gateway connection is a connection over IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel, connections can be used for cross-premises and hybrid configurations and requires a VPN device located on-premises that has a public IP address assigned to it
- **Virtual Network peering** connects 2 or more Virtual Networks in Azure 
- Traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the **Microsoft backbone infrastructure**
- **ExpressRoute** is _a high speed private connection to Azure_

#### Tutorials:
+ [Create and manage a VPN gateway using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-create-gateway-portal)
+ [Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal)
