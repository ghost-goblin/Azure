## ☁️ Describe Cloud Computing
### Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services
1. identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as **High Availability**, **Scalability**, **Elasticity**, **Agility**, and **Disaster Recovery**
+ **High Availability** is the _percentage_ (%) of the time system response to the user request i.e. how long a system component is operational
+ **Availability** is the accessibility of an application or system by end-users
> What causes unavailabilty?
>> Networking outage
>>> Application failure
>>>> Power outage
>>>>> Problems with external systems such as databases
+ **Scalability** is the long-term planning and implementations to deal with the increase / decrease in demand
+ **Elasticity** is the ability to aquire / release resources as and when it is needed
+ **Agility** refers to the ability of an organization to rapidly develop, test, and launch software applications that drive business growth _(addition of business value)_
+ **Disaster Recovery** is an organization's ability to respond to and recover from an event that negatively affects business operations

2. identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
3. describe the consumption-based model
