## ☁️ Describe Cloud Computing
### Identify the benefits and considerations of using cloud services
1. identify the benefits of cloud computing, such as **High Availability**, **Scalability**, **Elasticity**, **Agility**, and **Disaster Recovery**
+ **High Availability** is the _percentage_ (%) of the time system response to the user request i.e. how long a system component is operational
+ **Availability** is the accessibility of an application or system by end-users

>>> What causes unavailabilty?
1. Networking outage
2. Application failure
3. Power outage
4. Problems with external systems such as databases

2. identify the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
3. describe the consumption-based model
