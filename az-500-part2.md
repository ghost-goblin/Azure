# [Microsoft AZ-500](az-500-index.md): Microsoft Azure Security Technologies

## üõ°Ô∏è Implement platform protection (15-20%)

# üï∏Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Implement advanced network security
## Secure the connectivity of hybrid networks
## Secure the connectivity of virtual networks
### Network Security Group (NSG)
+ How do I create a Network Security Group? ... _just like with anything in Azure, you just create a **resource**_
+ Filter traffic to and from Azure resources
+ Contains security rules to allow or deny inbound/outbound traffic
+ Evaluated by priority using 5-tuple information
  1. Source Address
  2. Source Port
  3. Destination Address
  4. Destination Port
  5. Protocol
+ VMs (At the NIC level)
+ Subnets

### Role-based Access Groups
+ Principle of Least Privilege - user is given the minimum levels of access ‚Äì or permissions ‚Äì needed to perform their job functions
+ Security Principals - a security ID for applications or services
+ Roles
  - **Owner** has full access to all resources and grant access
  - **Contributor** can create/manage all resource, cannot grant access
  - **Reader** can view existing resources
  - **User Access Administrator** lets you mange user access
+ Scope
  - Adding the _Owner_ role at the _management group scope_ allows users in group to manage everything within all subscriptions
  - Adding the _Reader_ role at the _subscription scope_ allows users in that group to view all resource groups and resources in that subscription
  - Assigning the _Contributor_ role to an app at the _resource group_ scope allows it to manage resources within that group alone
