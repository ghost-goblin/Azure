## ü§ñ [Implement and manage hybrid identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/)

### üåâ Plan, design, and implement Azure Active Directory Connect
+ **Azure AD Connect** bridges an organizations on-premises Active Directory with your cloud-based Azure Active Directory
    - If you're installing **Azure AD Connect** for the first time, [choose the custom installation path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom)



# **Synchronization**

```ps1
Import-Module ADSync
Get-ADSyncScheduler
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
# Run the following command to force a complete sync but note that the length of sync time would be greatly increased
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial
````
      
      
# **Password hash synchronization**
[![Enable password hash synchronization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/single-sign-on-fd559a4b.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ When you install **Azure AD Connect** by using the `Express Settings` option, **Password Hash Synchronization** is automatically enabled

# **Pass-through authentication**
[![Enable password hash synchronization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/change-user-sign-in-60b54bee.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ Validates passwords directly against on-premises **Active Directory**
+ Sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based apps using the same password
+ A Pass-through authentication agent is installed on the same server as Azure AD Connect and the feature is enabled on your tenant


# **Federation integration**
[![Azure AD Connect to connect to an AD FS farm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/sc300-federation-setup-dialog-f995542d.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system such as **Active Directory Federation Services** (AD FS)
+ Specify the servers where you want to install AD FS
+ Specify the Web Application Proxy servers
    -  The **Web Application Proxy server** is deployed in your perimeter extranet network and supports external authentication requests

# **Health monitoring**
### `InvalidSoftMatch` error
+ 2 objects with different SourceAnchor `immutableId` have the same value for the `ProxyAddresses` and/or `UserPrincipalName` attributes
+ Generate a report by [Azure AD Connect Health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-sync) for sync

### Azure AD Connect design concepts
#### `sourceAnchor`
+ The `sourceAnchor` attribute, also called `immutableId`, is defined as an attribute immutable during the lifetime of an object
+ Uniquely identifies an object as being the same object on-premises and in Azure AD
#### `objectGuid`
+ The attribute `objectGuid` is used for a single forest on-premises
+ Used to express settings in **Azure AD Connect**


#### Azure AD sign-in
+ Azure AD uses `userPrincipalName` (UPN) to authenticate the user


| Azure AD Connect provisioning engine             |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Database on SSD                              |
| (< import) **Active Directory forest** (export >)|
| Connector Space (CS)                             |
| Metaverse (MV)                                   |

### üöë Implement Azure Active Directory Connect Health
[![Verify agent was installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/install-5-01ef9e2e.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ **Azure AD Premium**
+ **Global Administrator** in Azure AD
+ The Azure AD Connect Health agent is installed on each targeted server
+ The Azure service endpoints have outbound connectivity
+ Outbound connectivity is based on IP addresses
+ TLS inspection for outbound traffic is filtered or disabled
+ Firewall ports on the server are running the agent
+ The agent requires the following firewall ports to be open so that it can communicate with the Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints:
    + TCP port 443
    + TCP port 5671 _(the latest version of the agent doesn't require port 5671, ppgrade to the latest version so that only port 443 is required)_
+ PowerShell version 4.0 or newer is installed
+ FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) is disabled

[![Manage external collaboration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-external-identities/media/external-user-state-diagram.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ **B2B collaboration** is a capability of Azure AD External Identities that lets you collaborate with users and partners outside of your organization.

### Enable multifactor authentication
+ Something the user knows (Password)
+ Something the user owns (Device)
+ Something the user is (Biometrics)

### Implement **Azure AD Smart Lockout**
+ Edit the group policy that includes the organization's account lockout policy
    - Browse to Group Policy Management tool > Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy
+ **Azure Active Directory** > Authentication methods > Password protection

1. Windows Hello
2. FIDO2 security keys
3. Microsoft Authenticator
4. SMS
5. Certificate-based authrentication
6. Temporary Access Pass

### Enable FIDO2 security key method
+ `Azure Active Directory` > `Security` > `Authentication methods` > `Authentication method policy`
+ Under the method **FIDO2 Security Key**, choose the following options:
    - `Enable` - Yes or No
    - `Target` - All users or Select users
