## ü§ñ [Implement and manage hybrid identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/)

### üåâ Plan, design, and implement Azure Active Directory Connect
+ **Azure AD Connect** bridges an organizations on-premises Active Directory with your cloud-based Azure Active Directory
    - If you're installing **Azure AD Connect** for the first time, [choose the custom installation path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-custom)

1. **Synchronization**

```ps1
Import-Module ADSync
Get-ADSyncScheduler
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
# Run the following command to force a complete sync but note that the length of sync time would be greatly increased
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial
````

      
      
2. **Password hash synchronization**
[![Enable password hash synchronization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/single-sign-on-fd559a4b.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ When you install **Azure AD Connect** by using the `Express Settings` option, **Password Hash Synchronization** is automatically enabled

3. **Pass-through authentication**
+ Validates passwords directly against on-premises **Active Directory**
+ Sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based apps using the same password
+ A Pass-through authentication agent is installed on the same server as Azure AD Connect and the feature is enabled on your tenant


4. **Federation integration**
[![Azure AD Connect to connect to an AD FS farm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/sc300-federation-setup-dialog-f995542d.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ Azure AD hands off the authentication process to a separate trusted authentication system such as **Active Directory Federation Services** (AD FS)
+ Specify the servers where you want to install AD FS
+ Specify the Web Application Proxy servers
    -  The **Web Application Proxy server** is deployed in your perimeter extranet network and supports external authentication requests

5. **Health monitoring**
+ `InvalidSoftMatch` error
   + 2 objects with different SourceAnchor `immutableId` have the same value for the `ProxyAddresses` and/or `UserPrincipalName` attributes
   + Generate a report by [Azure AD Connect Health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-sync) for sync

### Azure AD Connect design concepts
#### `sourceAnchor`
+ The `sourceAnchor` attribute, also called `immutableId`, is defined as an attribute immutable during the lifetime of an object
+ Uniquely identifies an object as being the same object on-premises and in Azure AD
#### `objectGuid`
+ The attribute `objectGuid` is used for a single forest on-premises
+ Used to express settings in **Azure AD Connect**

### [Azure AD Connect: Enabling device writeback](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-device-writeback)
1. Install Azure AD Connect
2. Enable device writeback in Azure AD Connect
3. Verify Devices are synchronized to Active Directory
4. Enable Conditional Access
+ If you reset a password in Azure AD of a synced user, the password will be overwritten
+ If you join a computer to Azure AD, an object will be provisioned in the `RegisteredDevices` container
      
      
#### Azure AD sign-in
+ Azure AD uses `userPrincipalName` (UPN) to authenticate the user


| Azure AD Connect provisioning engine             |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Database on SSD                              |
| (< import) **Active Directory forest** (export >)|
| Connector Space (CS)                             |
| Metaverse (MV)                                   |
| Connector Space (CS)                             |
| (< import) **Azure AD** (export >)               |



### üöë Implement Azure Active Directory Connect Health
[![Verify agent was installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-sci/implement-manage-hybrid-identity/media/install-5-01ef9e2e.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/)
+ **Azure AD Premium**
+ **Global Administrator** in Azure AD
+ The Azure AD Connect Health agent is installed on each targeted server
+ The Azure service endpoints have outbound connectivity
+ Outbound connectivity is based on IP addresses
+ TLS inspection for outbound traffic is filtered or disabled
+ Firewall ports on the server are running the agent
+ The agent requires the following firewall ports to be open so that it can communicate with the Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints:
    + TCP port 443
    + TCP port 5671 _(the latest version of the agent doesn't require port 5671, ppgrade to the latest version so that only port 443 is required)_
+ PowerShell version 4.0 or newer is installed
+ FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) is disabled
 
#### [How to troubleshoot an AD Connect Instance](https://support.pingidentity.com/s/article/PingOne-How-to-troubleshoot-an-AD-Connect-Instance)
