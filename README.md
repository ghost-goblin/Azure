# ☁️ Microsoft Azure Services & Concepts


### Azure Data Centres

## Regions & Availability Zones
- Physical Deployment
- High Availability & Disaster Recovery
You need to choose the **region** (a.k.a. the datacentre/s) where you want the instance of the service created.
Not all Azure services are available in all regions.

## Azure Resource Groups
A resource is just a managable item in the cloud:
+ Virtual Machines
+ Storage Accounts
+ Web Apps
+ Databases
+ VNETs
+ etc.

A **Resourse Group** is a container that hold related resources. Resources share the same lifecycle i.e. deploy, update, delete together.
