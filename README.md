# ☁️ Microsoft Azure Services & Concepts

## Azure Data Centre Regions & Availability Zones
- Physical Deployment
- High Availability & Disaster Recovery
You need to choose the **region** (a.k.a. the datacentre/s) where you want the instance of the service created.
Not all Azure services are available in all regions.

## Azure Resource Groups
A resource is just a managable item in the cloud:
+ Virtual Machines
+ Storage Accounts
+ Web Apps
+ Databases
+ VNETs
+ etc.

### A **Resource Group** is a container that hold related resources.

+ Resources share the same lifecycle i.e. deploy, update, delete together
+ Resources can only exist in one Resource Group
+ Resource can communicate across Resource Groups
+ Container for security boundaries
+ Can export IAAS using __Resource Manager Templates__
+ Resources can be in different regions
